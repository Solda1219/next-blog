this is using of next(blot test)
this is the primary using of nextjs and here uses getStaticProps, getStaticPaths functions.
- getStaticProps function
this is for pre-rendering. this means it is pre rendered when building not depending on now state.
this is useful for components have static data.(this is not updated when props change so speed is quick but you must attention about this static and if you want to react with props change even using this function, you can set time and can update the time inteverl.)
